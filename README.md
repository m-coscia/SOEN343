# SOEN343 - Smart Home Simulator
SOEN 343 Group Project

**Smart Home Simulator** provides a graphical representation of interactions between household elements and IoT systems, allowing for experimentation, problem-solving, and optimization in a controlled virtual environment. This would make testing easier, help people understand smart home features better, and improve the overall user experience.
